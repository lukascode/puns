# Puns

Multiplayer drawing game in browser (Computer Science Engineering Thesis)

## Getting started

The purpose of the thesis is to create and design multiplayer network web application
where we can guess words based on drawing on canvas. The game will be possible in inten-
ded game rooms created by players. The game will be divided into rounds. In each round
random player will receive random word and he will have to describe the word with a dra-
wing. The rest in the room is supposed to guess the word based on drawing. The winner of
the round receives points.
